If no camera is linked to the P/T, all analyses are disabled, otherwise, only the linked camera's analyses are disabled. Eventually, we will need to add considerations for whether or not the analysis was enabled to begin with, and if the user even wants to disable them while moving. For some applications, you may want analyses to work while the P/T is in auto patrol mode.</li>

				<h3>(Bug) Deleting Disconnected Camera</h3>
				<li>Fixed the bug where deleting a camera that is not connected can crash the software.</li>

				<h3>(Bug) OPC Config Loading</h3>

			<h3>(Bug) Flir GigE Vision Exclusive Lock</h3>
			<li>
			    Some recent code was resulting in CameraDeviceInfo to be created for a single camera multiple times. This causes an exclusive lock error to fire 
			    and potentially prevents the camera from streaming. We modified that code to try and prevent that.

		    <h3>Updated Atlas</h3>
		    <li>Updated the Flir SDK. New version is meant to solve the RTSP crashing issue when streaming the new cameras in thermal mode.</li>

        
                    <h3>(Bug) Camera Dispose Delay</h3>
                    <li>Found a bug in Atlas that causes the camera's RTSP server to crash if disposing is started and not finished properly. Added a delay after disposing of the camera to prevent the RTSP servers from crashing.</li>
        
                    <h3>(Bug) Flir Camera Discovery</h3>
                    <li>Re-starting the Flir camera discovery every 30 seconds was causing an access violation in Atlas which resulted in ViperVision crashing. Took out the restart timer. Until a permanent fix is implemented for this, camera discovery may not find all available cameras.</li>

                    <h3>AX8 Integration</h3>
                    <li>Reintroduced the Flir AX8 to ViperVision but now with much more functionality. Nearly all functionality is supported. Still need settings for the thermal/visible alignment and turning on/off the lamp.</li>
        
                    <h3>Streaming Format Setting</h3>
                    <li>Added a setting for the camera's streaming format. For the new Flir cameras, this would allow the user to stream only the thermal image if they didn't want to stream the visible image.</li>
        
                    <h3>P/T Auto Patrol Dropdown</h3>
                    <li>Changed the P/T Auto patrol toggle switch to a dropdown with more options. You can now turn auto patrol for the selected P/T or for all connected P/Ts.</li>

                    <li>When loading a recipe after the P/T reaches a preset, the settings will load for the P/T's linked cameras independently of the others. This way, if you have two P/Ts and two cameras that are linked, when P/T 1 reaches a specific preset you can load ROIs for camera 1 only. This is useful if P/T 2 is still trying to reach its destination and not ready to load ROIs on camera 2 yet or if P/T has more stops than P/T 1. If there are no linked cameras for that P/T, the recipe will be loaded for all cameras.</li>
        
                    <h3>Flir Atlas x64 Update</h3>
                    <li>Includes the newest SDK update from Flir (currently only available for x64).</li>

                    <h3>(Bug) ICI Core Body Temperature Reading</h3>
                    <li>Fixed the bug where things in the background would affect this reading.</li>
        
                    <h3>(Bug) ICI Hot/Cold Spot ROI Indicator</h3>
                    <li>Fixed the bug where these indicators were backward.</li>

                    <h3>Web Server Replacement</h3>
                    <li>The older ASP.NET Framework web server was replaced with a lighter-weight, more modern ASP.NET Core web server. This new server has all camera feeds on it's home page by default.</li>
        
                    <h3>SQL Database improvements</h3>
                    <li>A better data infrastructure has been implemented for our SQL data tables. These new table formats should be easier for a SQL savvy customer to access them and understand what's going on with the data. Also, WAL was implemented so that ViperVision could write to the database even if a client was connected and reading data.</li>
        
                    <h3>ROI Handling</h3>
                    <li>ROI Added & Removed events from the Atlas SDK are no longer being utilized. Instead, we are handling the ROIs internally now and just verifying that the SDK has the correct settings after the fact.</li>
        
                    <h3>New Color Picker</h3>
                    <li>There is a new color picker control to make picking colors, like ROI or isotherm color, more user-friendly.</li>

                    <h3>Redesign</h3>
                    <li>The main form of the application has a more modern look to it. The settings menu is broken down into smaller pieces, however, the software remains live while making changes. We developed our own controls for textboxes, checkboxes, dropdowns, numeric up-downs, and buttons. Also, we have begun using a card approach to showing list data instead of the older style grids. But we have an ever-growing guru menu for users wanting a more involved experience.</li>
        
                    <h3>Licensing</h3>
                    <li>We implemented a new license scheme. This new approach allows us to provide online licensing by creating the license for the customer when they make a purchase and sending them a Registration Key. They can use that key while their PC is online for the software to communicate with our licensing site and get the corresponding license.</li>
        
                    <h3>Viewer</h3>
                    <li>ViperViewer has been pulled into the application and is no longer a stand-alone app. This will allow us to continue developing it so it does not get left behind. Files can be opened and docked just like live cameras. Any docked files load back up when the software reloads.</li>
        
                    <h3>CSV Report</h3>
                    <li>Changed the layout of the .csv report to meet Emitted's preferred structure.</li>

                    <h3>(Bug) Pan/Tilt Jittering</h3>
                    <li>There is a weird jittering effect when you stopped moving the P/T sometimes. This seems to happen when the command to move is sent with 0 pan and 0 tilt speeds. We made it so after the 0 pan and 0 tilt command is sent 5 consecutive times, it doesn't send it anymore.</li>
        
                    <h3>(Bug) Axis Freeze</h3>

                    <h3>New Axis Stream</h3>
                    <li>Now using VLC library to stream the Axis camera. This offloads the processing to the GPU and doesn't prevent the Flir A400/A700 from working properly when run at the same time. No longer need the Axis Media Control SDK. Will need to find a way to make recordings with this new streaming format.</li>
        
                    <h3>Range Selections</h3>
                    <li>After a recent Atlas 7 update, our previous workaround for the ranges no longer worked. They only fixed the issue in the 32 bit version of Atlas. So the temperatures don't show correctly in 64 bit version.</li>
