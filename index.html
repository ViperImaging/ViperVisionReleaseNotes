  <h1>ViperVision Release Notes v4.2.5.7</h1>
<ul>
  <h3>AX8 Integration</h3>
<li>Reintroduced the Flir AX8 to ViperVision but now with much more functionality. Nearly all functionality is supported. Still need settings for the thermal/visible alignment and turning on/off the lamp.</li>

  <h3>Streaming Format Setting</h3>
<li>Added a setting for the camera's streaming format. For the new Flir cameras, this would allow the user to stream only the thermal image if they didn't want to stream the visible image.</li>

<h3>P/T Auto Patrol Dropdown</h3>
<li>Changed the P/T Auto patrol toggle switch to a dropdown with more options. You can now turn auto patrol for the selected P/T or for all connected P/Ts.</li>

<h3>Preset Config Loading Process</h3>
<li>When loading a recipe after the P/T reaches a preset, the settings will load for the P/T's linked cameras independently of the others. This way, if you have two P/Ts and two cameras that are linked, when P/T 1 reaches a specific preset you can load ROIs for camera 1 only. This is useful if P/T 2 is still trying to reach its destination and not ready to load ROIs on camera 2 yet or if P/T has more stops than P/T 1. If there are no linked cameras for that P/T, the recipe will be loaded for all cameras.</li>

<h3>Flir Atlas x64 Update</h3>
<li>Includes the newest SDK update from Flir (currently only available for x64).</li>

<h3>Manual Update</h3>
<li>Included the newest edition of the Configuration Guide with updated info for the pan/tilt sections.</li>
