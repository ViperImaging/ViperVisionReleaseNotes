                <ul id="collapse-8" class="active" style="display: block;">
                    <h3>JumpList</h3>
                    <li>Now there is a "JumpList" available when right-clicking on the icon in the taskbar. The features currently available are: 
                        minimize software, maximize software (this helps when software gets stuck in the taskbar), 
                        open the configuration guide, and access 1 of the 5 most recent files saved by the software.
                    </li>
        
                    <h3>Taskbar Minimizing/Maximizing</h3>
                    <li>Now when you click on the application in the taskbar, if it is already minimized it will now maximize and vice versa.</li>
        
                    <h3>Enable P/T Preset By Default</h3>
                    <li>Now when adding presets to the pantilt the routes will be automatically included.</li>
        
                    <h3>(Bug) Manual Span For Video File</h3>
                    <li>Fixed the issue where changing the manual span for a saved file could cause the software to lock up.</li>
        
                    <h3>(Bug) Feed Data Context Menu</h3>
                    <li>Fixed the bug where newer analysis types did not show up properly in the right-click menu.</li>

                    <h3>(Bug) Add/Edit Windows Open On Main Monitor</h3>
                    <li>Fixed the issue where menus would open on screen 1 if the software was running on screen 2.</li>
        
                    <h3>(Bug) Camera Name Cannot End With Space</h3>
                    <li>Trimmed off the trailing space in the camera name.</li>
        
                    <h3>(Bug) Viewer Directory</h3>
                    <li>Fixed the issue where the Viewer only showed files in the directory C:\Viper.</li>
        
                    <h3>(Bug) ViperVision Displaying With Other Applications</h3>
                    <li>Fixed the issue where the software can pop up when you are clicking on another software in the taskbar.</li>
        
                    <h3>(Bug) Camera Digital Output Not Working</h3>
                    <li>Fixed a bug that caused the digital outputs to not fire based on the streaming mode.</li>
        
                    <h3>(Bug) Web Server Not Broadcasting</h3>

                </ul>
            </div>
            <div id="4.2.5.7">
                <div class="align"><i id="i7" class="fa fa-plus" onclick="makeLittle('collapse-7', 'i7')" aria-hidden="true"></i><h2>ViperVision4.2.5.7</h2></div>
                <ul id="collapse-7" class="inactive">
                      <h3>AX8 Integration</h3>
                    <li>Reintroduced the Flir AX8 to ViperVision but now with much more functionality. Nearly all functionality is supported. Still need settings for the thermal/visible alignment and turning on/off the lamp.</li>
        
                      <h3>Streaming Format Setting</h3>
                    <li>Added a setting for the camera's streaming format. For the new Flir cameras, this would allow the user to stream only the thermal image if they didn't want to stream the visible image.</li>
        
                    <h3>P/T Auto Patrol Dropdown</h3>
                    <li>Changed the P/T Auto patrol toggle switch to a dropdown with more options. You can now turn auto patrol for the selected P/T or for all connected P/Ts.</li>
        
                    <h3>Preset Config Loading Process</h3>
                    <li>When loading a recipe after the P/T reaches a preset, the settings will load for the P/T's linked cameras independently of the others. This way, if you have two P/Ts and two cameras that are linked, when P/T 1 reaches a specific preset you can load ROIs for camera 1 only. This is useful if P/T 2 is still trying to reach its destination and not ready to load ROIs on camera 2 yet or if P/T has more stops than P/T 1. If there are no linked cameras for that P/T, the recipe will be loaded for all cameras.</li>
        
                    <h3>Flir Atlas x64 Update</h3>
                    <li>Includes the newest SDK update from Flir (currently only available for x64).</li>
        
                    <h3>Manual Update</h3>
                    <li>Included the newest edition of the Configuration Guide with updated info for the pan/tilt sections.</li>
        
                    <h3>(Bug) PIP Mouse Coordinates</h3>
                    <li>Fixed the issue of the mouse coordinates not translating to the image coordinates correctly when using PIP Thermal or PIP Visible.</li>
        
                    <h3>(Bug) Timelapse Unit Setting</h3>
                    <li>Fixed the issue where the timelapse unit setting was not working.</li>
        
                    <h3>(Bug) Preset Load Config Setting</h3>
                    <li>Fixed the issue where the recipe name does not show up in the preset menu when editing the preset.</li>
        
                    <h3>(Bug) P/T Control Reset Auto Patrol Toggle</h3>
                    <li>Fixed the issue of the auto patrol toggle not reflecting the right setting when you change the selected P/T.</li>
        
                    <h3>(Bug) Snapshot Frequency Dual Camera</h3>
                    <li>Fixed the bug where snapshot frequency did not work for cameras with dual detectors.</li>
        
                    <h3>(Bug) Emailing Can Cause Crash</h3>
                    <li>Fixed the bug where sending an email can cause the software to crash.</li>
        
                    <h3>(Bug) Restart Button Increases Frequency Of Camera Issue</h3>
                    <li>Fixed the issue where using the restart button causes the camera "power cycle" issue to occur more frequently.</li>
        
                    <h3>(Bug) ICI Core Body Temperature Reading</h3>
                    <li>Fixed the bug where things in the background would affect this reading.</li>
        
                    <h3>(Bug) ICI Hot/Cold Spot ROI Indicator</h3>
                    <li>Fixed the bug where these indicators were backward.</li>
        
                      <h3>(Bug) ICI Flying Spot Wrong Temperature</h3>
                      <li>Fixed the bug where the temperature data for the flying spot was wrong.</li>
                </ul>

            <div id="4.2.4.6">
                <div class="align"><i id="i6" class="fa fa-plus" onclick="makeLittle('collapse-6', 'i6')" aria-hidden="true"></i><h2>ViperVision4.2.4.6</h2></div>
                <ul id="collapse-6" class="inactive">
                      <h3>Web Server Replacement</h3>
                    <li>The older ASP.NET Framework web server was replaced with a lighter-weight, more modern ASP.NET Core web server. This new server has all camera feeds on it's home page by default.</li>
        
                      <h3>SQL Database improvements</h3>
                    <li>A better data infrastructure has been implemented for our SQL data tables. These new table formats should be easier for a SQL savvy customer to access them and understand what's going on with the data. Also, WAL was implemented so that ViperVision could write to the database even if a client was connected and reading data.</li>
        
                    <h3>ROI Handling</h3>
                    <li>ROI Added & Removed events from the Atlas SDK are no longer being utilized. Instead, we are handling the ROIs internally now and just verifying that the SDK has the correct settings after the fact.</li>
        
                    <h3>New Color Picker</h3>
                    <li>There is a new color picker control to make picking colors, like ROI or isotherm color, more user-friendly.</li>
        
                    <h3>New Licensing Menus</h3>
                    <li>There are new menus for the licensing process aimed at making the process more user-friendly.</li>
        
                    <h3>SEQ File Processes</h3>
                    <li>Now, you can create a Process for these files.</li>
        
                    <h3>(Bug) ROI Keys Not Working</h3>
                    <li>Fixed the issue where the hotkeys were not working to adjust ROIs.</li>
        
                    <h3>(Bug) EBT Processes Not Working</h3>
                    <li>Fixed the issue where under some conditions, established EBT processes would not be performed after an EBT scan.</li>
        
                    <h3>(Bug) EBT Report Errors</h3>
                    <li>Fixed the issue where the camera name, total # of scans, and # of failed scans were wrong in the EBT report.</li>
        
                    <h3>(Bug) Many Camera Rotation</h3>
                    <li>Fixed the issue where using rotation with Atlas can cause the ROI location data to be messed up.</li>

                    <h3>Redesign</h3>
                    <li>The main form of the application has a more modern look to it. The settings menu is broken down into smaller pieces, however, the software remains live while making changes. We developed our own controls for textboxes, checkboxes, dropdowns, numeric up-downs, and buttons. Also, we have begun using a card approach to showing list data instead of the older style grids. But we have an ever-growing guru menu for users wanting a more involved experience.</li>
        
                    <h3>Licensing</h3>
                    <li>We implemented a new license scheme. This new approach allows us to provide online licensing by creating the license for the customer when they make a purchase and sending them a Registration Key. They can use that key while their PC is online for the software to communicate with our licensing site and get the corresponding license.</li>
        
                    <h3>Viewer</h3>
                    <li>ViperViewer has been pulled into the application and is no longer a stand-alone app. This will allow us to continue developing it so it does not get left behind. Files can be opened and docked just like live cameras. Any docked files load back up when the software reloads.</li>
        
                    <h3>CSV Report</h3>
                    <li>Changed the layout of the .csv report to meet Emitted's preferred structure.</li>
